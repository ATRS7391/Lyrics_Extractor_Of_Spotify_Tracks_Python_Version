1. Make a folder named 'Lyrics' in the same directory of 'LyricsExtractor.py'.

2. Go to 'https://genius.com/api-clients/new'. Login if required then make a new API Client. Then copy the Client
Access Token. Then paste in 'API_Credentials.json''s "Genius_Client_Access_Token" key value which now is "None". Make sure they are
within double quotes.

3. Go to 'https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications'. Login if required, then click on 'CREATE AN APP'. Make
one quickly then copy the 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret'. Then paste them in their respective keys in
'API_Credentials.json'

4. Now open Spotify and then copy the url of the track or playlist of which you want to get lyrics.

5. Open 'LyricsExtractor.py' then wait. Wait for the program to install required modules and packages. [First time only]
Then it will automatically start extracting the lyrics.

6. After successful extraction of lyrics, open 'Lyrics' folder.


NOTE: After getting and pasting the correct API Credentials in the proper place, you may need to wait for sometime.
NOTE 2: If it doesn't works, make sure Python 3 or above is installed. If still doesn't then open with Powershell
or Command Prompt for Windows and Terminal for MacOS.
